# seattle data
This file set comes from https://www.kaggle.com/seattle-public-library/seattle-library-checkout-records

Using this data as a training set for myself to learn github and try some fun modeling. I'm also going to use the readme file as a work tracker for myself until I build out a better structure.

Current status-

First crack at reviewing some data and push/pull with Git. Some complications but making progress. The data itself is interesting, ended up into a rabbit hole with creating a language variable after finding some trend patterns in the Language category. Head back into more variable creation after looking at merging book data into the checkout data.

summary_all needs to be reviewed for accuracy, but gives checkout counts and item counts by item by month. So this could be used to predict both the number of books that will be checked out, and how many books the library should hold broadly to accommodate the need.

Need to do-
Regex on Description Column in checkout data.
